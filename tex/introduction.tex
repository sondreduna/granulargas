The central algorithm for event-driven simulations is the following \cite{event_sim}:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	Set velocities and positions of all particles in the gas\;
	Choose a stop criterion\;
	\For{each particle in gas}{
		Calculate if and when the particle will collide with all the other particles and the walls\;
		Store all the collision times\;
	}
	\While{not reached stop criterion}{
		Identify the earliest collision\;
		
		\eIf{collision is valid}{
			Move all particles in straight lines until the earliset collision\;
			\For{each particle involved in collision}{
				Calculate if and when the particle will collide with all the other particles and the walls\;
				Store all the collision times\;
			} 
		}{
			Discard collsion\;
		}
	}
	\caption{Event driven simulation of a gas.}
\end{algorithm}

In the above algorithm, a collision is marked \textit{valid} if the particle(s) involved in the collision has \textit{not} collided since the time the collision time was stored.
