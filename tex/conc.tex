\part{Conclusion}

We have used a event-driven procedure to simulate a $2$-dimensional gas of colliding discs. As predicted by classical statistical mechanics, the distribution of speeds of the particles in this gas follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in equilibrium. In the presence of energy dissipation, a system consisting of heavy and light gas particles is demonstrated to \textit{not} reach equilibrium. These demonstrations indicates that this simulation approach agrees with the more orthodox method of integrating the equations of motion. This fact is quite remarkable as the method used here only relies on the assumption that the particles undergo linear motion with constant velocity between the collisions, with no mention of any Hamiltonian nor Newtonian equation of motion.
